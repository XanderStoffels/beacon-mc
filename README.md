# Beacon

## A Minecraft Java edition server implementation written in .NET

This is a hobby project, inspired by [Obsidian MC](https://github.com/ObsidianMC/Obsidian), where my main focus regarding Minecraft Server development still remains. Please go check that out as well! Beacon basically is a try out project for features I would like to try out or like to see in Obsidian one day.

## Builds

Currently, because the game is not playable at this stage, there are no builds available.
