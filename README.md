# Beacon

## A Minecraft Java edition server implementation written in .NET

This is a hobby project, inspired by [Obsidian MC](https://github.com/ObsidianMC/Obsidian). Please go check that out as well! Beacon basically is a try out project for features I would like to try out or like to see in Obsidian one day.

## Builds

Currently, because the game is not playable at this stage, there are no builds available.

## Contributing

Please do, by all means! Create an issue so we can discuss your ideas further.
